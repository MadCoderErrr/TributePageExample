# TributePageExample

Hi guys, I am new at HTML and CSS so after I finished some online tutorial in the internet, I made some exercises (and this is my first one!).
This is a tribute page about bees. I hope this TributePageExample can help you to think of some ideas for your own tribute page (I am assuming you're
a beginner too). By the way, if you think I've written some unnecessary code, please tell me. Good luck!
