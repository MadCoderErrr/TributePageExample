            <h2>What Are Bees And What Do They Do?</h2>
            <p> Bees are one of the pollinators. It means that they spread the pollens of flowers into female stigma of a flower.
                But so what if they pollinate? What does pollination have to do with our environment?</p>
            <p> Pollination is important because this is the way how the flowers, trees and plants produce seeds. And of course, seeds means more plants! And more plants means clean air for everyone,
                more food, more species thriving, and a lot more!</p>
            <p>But of course, not all bees are equal. Some of them pollinate more than the others. But it doesn7t mean that we
               should ignore them.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, pollination results in the production of seeds and is necessary for many plants to reproduce. And bees are just one of the pollinators who are helping the environment by doing the pollination.</p>
